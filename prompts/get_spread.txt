Based on the conversation, identify:
- tokenId: The specific token ID for which to retrieve the spread (required)
- query: Search terms or keywords that might contain a token ID

Look for:
- Numbers following words like "token", "for token", "token ID", "market", etc.
- Standalone numbers that could be token IDs
- Any numeric identifiers in the message
- References to "spread", "bid-ask spread", "market spread"

Examples:
- "Get spread for token 123456" → tokenId: "123456"
- "Show spread for market 789012" → tokenId: "789012"
- "SPREAD 345678" → tokenId: "345678"
- "What's the spread for token 999999" → tokenId: "999999"
- "Show me the bid-ask spread for 777777" → tokenId: "777777"

Respond with a JSON object containing only the extracted values.
The JSON should have this structure:
{
    "tokenId"?: string,
    "query"?: string
}

If you find a token ID, always include it in the tokenId field.
If no valid token identifier is found, you MUST respond with the following JSON structure:
{
    "error": "Token identifier not found. Please specify a token ID for the spread."
}
