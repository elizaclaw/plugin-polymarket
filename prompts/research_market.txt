Based on the conversation, identify:
- marketId: The market condition ID (required if available)
- marketQuestion: The prediction market question being researched (required)
- forceRefresh: Whether to force new research even if cached results exist (optional, default false)
- callbackAction: What to do after research completes - "EVALUATE_TRADE" to auto-evaluate trade, "NOTIFY_ONLY" to just notify (optional)

Look for:
- Condition IDs (0x-prefixed hex strings or alphanumeric identifiers)
- Market questions or descriptions like "Will X happen?", "What are the odds of Y?"
- Keywords indicating refresh like "refresh", "update", "new research", "fresh"
- Trade-related context suggesting they want to trade after research

Examples:
- "Research the Bitcoin $100k market"
  { "marketQuestion": "Will Bitcoin reach $100k by end of 2025?", "forceRefresh": false }
- "Do deep research on market 0x123abc about the Fed rate decision"
  { "marketId": "0x123abc", "marketQuestion": "Will the Fed raise interest rates in March?", "forceRefresh": false }
- "Refresh the research for the election prediction market"
  { "marketQuestion": "Who will win the 2024 US Presidential election?", "forceRefresh": true }
- "Research this market before I trade: Will Company X acquire Company Y?"
  { "marketQuestion": "Will Company X acquire Company Y?", "callbackAction": "EVALUATE_TRADE" }
- "What's the research status for market 0xdef456?"
  { "marketId": "0xdef456", "forceRefresh": false }

Respond with a JSON object containing only the extracted values.
The JSON should have this structure:
{
    "marketId"?: string,
    "marketQuestion"?: string,
    "forceRefresh"?: boolean,
    "callbackAction"?: "EVALUATE_TRADE" | "NOTIFY_ONLY"
}

If no valid market information is found, you MUST respond with:
{
    "error": "Could not identify market to research. Please specify a market ID or market question."
}
