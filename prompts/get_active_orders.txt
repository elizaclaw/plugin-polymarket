extract parameters for retrieving active orders for a specific market.

Based on the conversation, identify:
- marketId: The market condition ID (required)
- assetId: The specific asset ID (token ID) within that market (optional, but often implied or can be derived if not explicitly stated by user for a binary market - you can initially assume the first token if not clear or ask user to clarify if multiple tokens exist for the market and it's ambiguous)

Look for:
- "market ID", "market", "condition ID" followed by an identifier for marketId.
- "token ID", "asset ID", "token" followed by an identifier for assetId.
- Phrases like "active orders for market X and token Y", "open orders on market Z"

Examples:
- "Show active orders for market 0xMarket123 and token 0xTokenABC"
  { "marketId": "0xMarket123", "assetId": "0xTokenABC" }
- "Get open orders for market condition_def456 asset_xyz789"
  { "marketId": "condition_def456", "assetId": "asset_xyz789" }
- "What are the active orders on market someMarketID?"
  { "marketId": "someMarketID" } // assetId might be omitted if it can be inferred or if the user should be prompted for it

Respond with a JSON object containing only the extracted values.
The JSON should have this structure:
{
    "marketId"?: string,
    "assetId"?: string
}

If the marketId is not found, you MUST respond with the following JSON structure:
{
    "error": "Market ID not found. Please specify a market ID."
}

If marketId is found but assetId is ambiguous or missing and seems required, you can omit assetId or include an additional field like "clarification_needed": "assetId". For now, prioritize extracting what is available.
