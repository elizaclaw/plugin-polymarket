extract parameters for retrieving a user's trade history.

Review the recent messages:
<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>

Based on the conversation, identify any of the following optional filters:
- userAddress: The user's wallet address (e.g., 0x...).
- marketId: The specific market condition ID.
- tokenId: The specific asset ID (token ID).
- fromDate: A start date or time period for the trades (e.g., "yesterday", "last week", "2023-01-15", "3 days ago").
- toDate: An end date or time period for the trades (e.g., "today", "2023-01-20").
- limit: Maximum number of trades to return (e.g., 25, 100).
- nextCursor: Pagination cursor for fetching the next page of results.

Look for:
- Wallet addresses (0x...).
- Identifiers for markets or tokens.
- Phrases like "trades for user X", "my trade history", "trades on market Y".
- Date/time references like "since last Monday", "between date A and date B", "in the last 24 hours".
- Keywords like "limit", "cursor", "page".

Examples:
- "Show my trade history for market 0xMarket123 from last week, limit 50"
  { "marketId": "0xMarket123", "fromDate": "last week", "limit": 50 }
- "Get trades for user 0xUserAddress on token 0xTokenABC since 2023-05-01 until 2023-05-10"
  { "userAddress": "0xUserAddress", "tokenId": "0xTokenABC", "fromDate": "2023-05-01", "toDate": "2023-05-10" }
- "Fetch next page of my trades with cursor XYZ123"
  { "nextCursor": "XYZ123" }
- "What were my trades yesterday?"
  { "fromDate": "yesterday", "toDate": "yesterday" } // Or just fromDate: "yesterday"

Respond with a JSON object containing only the extracted values.
All fields are optional. The JSON should have this structure:
{
    "userAddress"?: string,
    "marketId"?: string,
    "tokenId"?: string,
    "fromDate"?: string, // Extracted as string, will be parsed by the action
    "toDate"?: string,   // Extracted as string, will be parsed by the action
    "limit"?: number,
    "nextCursor"?: string
}

If no specific filters are mentioned that can be mapped to these parameters, you can respond with an empty JSON object {} or a JSON object indicating no filters, for example:
{
    "info": "No specific trade history filters identified. Will attempt to fetch recent trades for the current user if identifiable, or all trades if no user context."
}
