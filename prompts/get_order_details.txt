extract the order ID for retrieving order details.

Review the recent messages:
<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>

Based on the conversation, identify:
- orderId: The specific order ID (required)

Look for:
- Alphanumeric strings following "order ID", "order", "ID"
- Phrases like "details for order XYZ", "get order ABC"

Examples:
- "Get details for order 123xyz"
  { "orderId": "123xyz" }
- "Show me order abc789"
  { "orderId": "abc789" }
- "What are the details for 0x123abc?"
  { "orderId": "0x123abc" }

Respond with a JSON object containing only the extracted values.
The JSON should have this structure:
{
    "orderId"?: string
}

If no valid order ID is found, you MUST respond with the following JSON structure:
{
    "error": "Order ID not found. Please specify an order ID."
}
