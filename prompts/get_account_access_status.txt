confirm if the user wants to check their Polymarket account access status, such as U.S. certification requirements.

Review the recent messages:

Based on the conversation, determine if the user is asking about:
- Account status
- Certification requirements (e.g., "Am I certified?", "Do I need U.S. certification?")
- API key details or access levels

If the intent is to get account access status, respond with an empty JSON object:
{}

If the intent is unclear or unrelated to account access status, respond with:
{
    "error": "The query does not seem to be about account access status. Please clarify if you want to check your Polymarket account certification or API key status."
}

Examples:
- "Check my account access"
  {}
- "Am I certified to trade on Polymarket?"
  {}
- "What's my API key status?"
  {}
- "Show me the weather tomorrow"
  { "error": "The query does not seem to be about account access status..." }
