extract one or more order IDs for checking their scoring status.

Review the recent messages:
<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>

Based on the conversation, identify:
- orderIds: An array of specific order IDs (required)

Look for:
- Alphanumeric strings following "order ID", "orders", "IDs"
- Phrases like "check scoring for orders XYZ, ABC", "are orders 123 and 456 scoring?"
- Comma or space-separated lists of order IDs.

Examples:
- "Are orders 123xyz and abc789 scoring?"
  { "orderIds": ["123xyz", "abc789"] }
- "Check scoring status for order 0x123abc"
  { "orderIds": ["0x123abc"] }
- "Show me if myOrder1, myOrder2, myOrder3 are scoring"
  { "orderIds": ["myOrder1", "myOrder2", "myOrder3"] }

Respond with a JSON object containing only the extracted values.
The JSON should have this structure:
{
    "orderIds"?: string[]
}

If no valid order IDs are found, you MUST respond with the following JSON structure:
{
    "error": "Order ID(s) not found. Please specify one or more order IDs."
}
