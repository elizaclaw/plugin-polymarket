Your task is to extract parameters for subscribing to Polymarket WebSocket channels from the user query.
Extract the following parameters if present:
- markets: An array of market condition IDs (strings, usually 0x prefixed hex strings).
- userId: The user's wallet address (a string, 0x prefixed hex string).

User query: """{{message.content.text}}"""

If you cannot find a required parameter, or if the query is ambiguous, set "error" to a brief explanation.
If the user explicitly states they want to connect without specific market or user subscriptions (e.g., just to open the connection), output empty arrays/strings for optional fields if not specified.

Example 1:
User query: "Subscribe to market 0x123 and 0x456, and my user ID 0xabc."
Output:
{
  "markets": ["0x123", "0x456"],
  "userId": "0xabc"
}

Example 2:
User query: "Listen to my trades."
Output:
{
  "error": "User ID (wallet address) is required to listen to your trades. Please provide it."
}

Example 3:
User query: "Connect to Polymarket websockets for market 0xdef."
Output:
{
  "markets": ["0xdef"]
}

Output JSON:
